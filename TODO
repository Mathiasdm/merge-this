Ideas
=====

Typical editing patterns to test for conflicts:
    * changing indentation

Score conflicts based on how big they are.  No conflict has size 0
which is the best. For others, count how many lines are present in
'theirs', 'ours' and 'base' sections of the conflict.  This gives a
metric to compare VCS tools even if they all conflict.  Smaller
conflicts are generally easier to resolve.

Observations
============

Mercurial doesn't display merge base content inside merge conflict markers.
